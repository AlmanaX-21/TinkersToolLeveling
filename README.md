* This is an unofficial port of the mod.


# Tinkers' Tool Leveling

You know back in the days, when you played GTA and used the cheat code for a tank, and then went on and caused mayhem? This mod is like that, except for tinker tools and the cheatcode takes longer to enter.


Gives your Tools XP, allowing them to level up. On levelup an extra modifier is rewarded.
You get xp for doing whatever the tool was intended for, so breaking blocks with pickaxes, killing things with swords, etc.

Note that swords get xp relative to the damage dealt when the entity is killed, not when the damage is dealt. You only get xp if the mob is killed!

## Further Development

SlimeKnights have moved onto 1.16+ for mod development, so this repository has been locked. If you have further issues, feel free to make a fork of the mod.

We do not have any immediate plans to port this mod to 1.16 as it violates some of the design decisions we made in Tinkers Construct 3. However, many members of the community have expressed interest in the concept so a tool leveling addon is possible in the future.
